Updated on 23 April 2013, Swiss Ephemeris 1.79
- Improved precision in eclipse calculations: 2nd and 3rd contact with solar eclipses, penumbral and partial phases with lunar eclipses. 
- Bug fix in function swe_sol_eclipse_when_loc().If the local maximum eclipse occurs at sunset or sunrise, tret[0] now gives the moment when the lower limb of the Sun touches the horizon. This was not correctly implemented in former versions
- Bug fix in Perl functions swe_house() etc. These functions had crashed with a segmention violation if called with the house parameter ‘G’.
- Bug fix in Perl function swe_utc_to_jd(), where gregflag had been read from the 4th instead of the 6th parameter.
- Bug fix in Perl functions to do with date conversion. The default mechanism for gregflag was buggy.  
- For Hindu astrologers, some more ayanamshas were added that are related to Suryasiddhanta and Aryabhata and are of historical interest. 

Updated on 31 August 2012
- Function swe_house_name() added for Swiss Ephemeris 1.80

SwissEph version 1.76
=====================

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

INSTALLATION

On Linux:
=========

  Before installing this module, you have to install a shared library of
  the Swiss Ephemeris functions. Use the file libswe.so.1.76.00 (or whatever
  version it is) which is in the Swiss Ephemeris package or on the
  Swiss Ephemeris web site in the download area. Copy this file to 
  /usr/lib and run ldconfig(8) in order to generate the symbolic links
  required.

    cp usr/lib/libswe.so.1.76.00 /usr/lib
    ldconfig

  Now you can install the Perl module for the Swiss Ephemeris.
  Type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

On Windows:
===========

  Before installing this module, you have to install the following things
  on your computer:

  - the Swiss Ephemeris DLL swedll32.dll. If haven't done this yet,
    download the Swiss Ephemeris from the download area at 
    www.astro.com/swisseph and unpack it.

  - Visual C++ Express Edition, which can be downloaded for free from the
    http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/.

  After that you can install the Perl module. In the current directory 
  (where you read this README file), open the file Makefile.PL and
  fix the LIBS parameter. It must contain the directory to the Swiss Ephemeris
  DLL. After that run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install
